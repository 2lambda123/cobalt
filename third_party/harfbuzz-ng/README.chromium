Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

I also deleted all unneeded files from the root directory (but left src/ alone).

MSVS compiler warnings 4334, 4800, and 4805 have been disabled in harfbuzz.gyp
when the target architecture is "win" to enable building harfbuzz-ng on Windows
when warnings are set to break the build.
